# Hospital Patient Flow Simulation – FlexSim Project

This repository contains a FlexSim Professional simulation model developed to optimize patient flow in a healthcare facility. The model simulates the journey of patients through key hospital departments—Registration, Triage, Consultation, and Discharge—while aiming to minimize patient waiting time and optimize staff utilization.

## 📁 Project File

- `Nekky_Ihesie_HealthCare Project.fsm` – FlexSim simulation model file (requires FlexSim Professional to open and run)

## 📌 Project Objective

The primary goal of this simulation is to:
- Reduce patient waiting time at each stage of the care process
- Optimize the allocation and utilization of hospital staff
- Identify potential bottlenecks in patient flow
- Evaluate system performance using dashboard metrics and visual outputs

## 🏥 Simulated Components

The following processes are included in the model:
1. **Registration** – Initial intake of patients
2. **Triage** – Assessment of patient urgency levels
3. **Consultation** – Examination and treatment by medical staff
4. **Discharge** – Final stage where patients leave the system

## ⚙️ Features Used

- **Process Flow Logic** – Modeled realistic patient journey through modular components
- **Dashboards** – Monitored real-time system performance metrics (e.g., waiting times, resource utilization)
- **Staff Resource Allocation** – Included logic for dynamic staff assignment across patient processes

## Requirements

- FlexSim Professional (version used: latest as of 2025)
- Windows OS (recommended)
- Sufficient RAM/CPU for simulation visualization

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open FlexSim Professional.
3. Load the `.fsm` file using `File > Open`.
4. Run the simulation and explore results using the included dashboards and performance metrics.

## 📊 Analysis Opportunities

You can use this model to:
- Run experiments (e.g., change number of staff or patient arrival rate)
- Visualize system bottlenecks
- Compare different resource allocation strategies
- Improve overall hospital throughput
